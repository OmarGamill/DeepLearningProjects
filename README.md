# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains three different machine learning projects showcasing various techniques and models. Below are the details of each project:

## 1. Auto MPG Prediction
**File:** `Auto_mpg_data.ipynb`

- **Objective:** Predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of automobiles based on various features.
- **Dataset Columns:**
  - MPG
  - Cylinders
  - Displacement
  - Horsepower
  - Weight
  - Acceleration
  - Model Year
  - Origin
- **Description:** This project involves preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and building regression models to predict the MPG of cars.

## 2. MNIST Deep Learning
**File:** `Mnist_deep_learning.ipynb`

- **Objective:** Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Description:** This project uses deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to achieve high accuracy in digit classification. It involves building, training, and evaluating a deep neural network model.

## 3. Cats & Dogs Classification
**File:** `classification_cats&dogs.ipynb`

- **Objective:** Classify images of cats and dogs.
- **Description:** This project involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used includes labeled images of cats and dogs, and the project demonstrates the steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
